The first task was to pack the rails application in a docker container image. This can be easily done by creating a Dockerfile. In the Dockerfile that I wrote, I used ruby:3.0.5 as the base image and installed mysql-client by including RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client in the Dockerfile. After that a directory is created inside the container with name rails-app and the src/ directory of the app from the host filesystem is copied into the the rails-app directory of the container. After that the gems specified by Gemfile are downloaded by running bundle install. Now using the Dockerfile we build the image by running docker build -t rails-app ./. We can check the created image by running docker images. ![task1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78025461/229193418-e3eaa316-43f3-41fa-ab84-5e6010e97b87.png)

The next task was to launch a separate container for database and the two containers should be able to connect to each other. I did this by writing a docker-compose.yml file since it's easy to run multi-container apps using docker-compose.yml. I created two nodes db and web and the web node is linked to the db node. I mapped the port number 3306 of docker container to the port number of 3306 of host. Similarly, I mapped the port number of 3000 of docker container to the port number of 8080 of host so that the app can be accessed at http://localhost:8080. Now the web app is accessed by running docker compose up and reaching out to localhost:8080. Also, we need to migrate the database.![task2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78025461/229193446-b0f7d2de-079f-4e84-83ef-1baf86382811.png)
After creating an account in the website, we can see the data stored in the database by starting a bash shell inside the mysql container and logging into mysql.![task2(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78025461/229194580-c7229463-178f-474a-ab00-3746aac1bf25.png)
